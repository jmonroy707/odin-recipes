        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pkg of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups of warm water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups of AP flour</li>
            <li>1/2 lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>1 sm onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 can(15oz) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 medium green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded part-skimmed mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. <br>
                Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes.<br>
                 Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.<br>
                  Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.
            </li>
            <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust.<br>
                 Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
            </li>
        </ol>
